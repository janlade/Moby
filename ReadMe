1. Please find a PDF and Word file listing the implemented functionalities (split into MUST-HAVEs and NICE-TO-HAVEs) in the documentation folder.

2.Username are case sensitive 

3.Location search/post are not case sensitive

4.Openroute API-KEY: 5b3ce3597851110001cf6248f43db33892644b6d808f1af271890c4e

5.Map only shows results within 300km radius of Lörrach and in Germany (partially solves the problem with multiple locations sharing the same name, the better solution would be getting a more accurate information from the back server)

6.Leaflet installation needed

7.In the new post page (page_3) we do have a check for location but because of the strucutre of Openroute API even wrong location name the response still gives 200 back. So the checking up is a mock.
