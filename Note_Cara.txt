Note:
1.Username case senstive 
2.location search/post not case senstive
3.blue in logo: #5a6aaf
4.positionstack Geocoding API user&pw: dhbw email https://positionstack.com/dashboard
5.map start point freiburg lat ln
6.page_3 new post id is not dynamic
7.detail page not working properly in chrome (firefox will do)


 

Todo:
3. no route found msg move to the center
4. search button not relative
5. left and right column same height still shaky (left too short always)
6. check: #left-content {
height: 100%;
width: 80%;
} for page 2 why?
9. page_3 id tracking is bit cheating: check the local json file instead of the API(Git automation?)




Problem to discuss:
1.if we set up a small server to really be able to write data into JSON or just use localStorage?
2.should the new post to be shown? (a landing page?)
